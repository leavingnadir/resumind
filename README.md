 #  A Can't PDF Convert to PNG Error

Explanation of the Error and Fix

○ The error happens because the PDF.js library (pdfjs-dist) and the PDF worker file (pdf.worker.min.mjs) are running on different versions.
○ Your library is using API version 5.4.149.
○ But the worker file is still on version 5.3.93.
○ Since the library and worker must always match exactly, this mismatch causes the PDF conversion to fail.

## How to Fix

You have two options:

01. Update the worker file to match the library (recommended)

○ Make sure you are using the latest version of pdfjs-dist:
```
npm install pdfjs-dist@latest
```

Then copy the correct worker file from node_modules into your public folder:
```
copy .\node_modules\pdfjs-dist\build\pdf.worker.min.mjs .\public\pdf.worker.min.mjs
```
○ Now the worker and library versions will be the same, and the error will disappear.

02. Downgrade the library to match the worker

○ If you cannot update the worker file, you can change your package.json to use the older version (e.g., pdfjs-dist@5.3.93) and run:
```
npm install
```
